Features / What’s Inside

Data loading and initial inspection

Cleaning data: handling missing values, dealing with inconsistent entries

Univariate analysis: distribution of features (numerical and categorical)

Bivariate / multivariate analysis: relationships between features (e.g. how certain features relate to churn)

Visualization of important trends

Summary of key observations

Tech Stack & Dependencies

Language: Python

Notebook environment: Jupyter Notebook

Main libraries (likely used):

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Environment setup:

# Example setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Use / Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Smriti1477/telco_cust_churn_analysis_eda_python.git
cd telco_cust_churn_analysis_eda_python


Install dependencies (as above).

Open the notebook TCCA.ipynb in Jupyter or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook TCCA.ipynb


Follow through the notebook: data load → cleaning → EDA → visualization → summary.

If you like, I can prepare a polished README markdown file content (that you can copy directly into README.md). Do you want me to generate that?
