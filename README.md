Key Insights (from EDA)

Customer tenure, contract type, and payment method play significant roles in churn.

Month-to-month contracts and electronic check payments have higher churn rates.

Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn compared to long-term customers.

High monthly charges correlate with increased churn probability.
